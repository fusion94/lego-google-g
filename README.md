# LEGO Google G Logo

### G, a puzzle!
This was an Official Google promotional puzzle that was given out at hackathons etc a few years ago. This design is slightly different from the original as after running it through Studio's stability checker there were some potential issues in terms of stability & clutch power. 

**To Note:** Those are not completely resolved but it's a vast improvement.

It was designed using [Studio](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page) from BrickLink.

### What is Studio?
Studio is a desktop application that allows users to build LEGO models using virtual parts. Users will have the freedom to build anything they want with any LEGO part. By being integrated with the BrickLink catalog, Studio can do things like showing you what part colors are unavailable and letting you keep track of part costs. Studio also makes it easy to turn a finished creation into a wanted list that you can use to order through BrickLink.

Studio is completely free to use and runs on both Windows and Mac. Although a BrickLink account is not necessary to run Studio, registered users will have the added bonus of being able to build with friends in real-time.
